This is the information guide to the Flex Project and will serve as my workinh journal of the process to complete it!

-- The Frame section is for the building blocks that it runs on. It will be running in a docker container, built to have all the needed pieces installed. This includes Python, the AWS CLI and Terraform. The dockerfile when finshed will also be responsible for moving all of the code repo stored locally into the docker image, which will become the running container. This will allow the easiet and best way for all the code to be added, edited or removed and then know that the application runnning is the latest version. Containers are sweet. This will be published to a public GIT repo, so updating will be very easy. When this is pushed out as a complete package it will use a docker compose JSON file to handle the deployment of the app to the local machine it will be running on. Maybe eventually I will get it running in K8 so updating and usage are made better. For now I need to work on getting a solid 3 templates of Cloud Infrastructure builds into the app and have it run locally to depoy one of these templates into the AWS cloud service. And down the road maybe have it run in Azure and GCP, but again for now, I will stick to what I know and just have it work with AWS.
